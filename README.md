## Hike site description
I was inspired to make this project after I learned a lot about CSS Grids and Flexbox and wanted to practice those skills. So this is built using the CSS grid.

I developed this idea and project all on my own. I love hiking and figured it would be a good topic to keep me motivated to work on and finish this project.

The site has buttons that toggle the not completed and completed hikes and an all button that shows all the hikes again. This functionality took me a couple days to get right. Long story short I was trying to toggle just one class that changed display to 'none' where I really need to add and remove classes that changed the display between 'block' and 'none'.

I am proud of this project because I was able to solve all the problems I had mostly on my own using online resources and Chrome developer tools.
